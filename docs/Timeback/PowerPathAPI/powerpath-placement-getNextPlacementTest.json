Tests will also be marked as exhausted.\n- If the student hasn't completed a single placement test, returns the first placement test's lesson ID for the subject.\n- If the student has completed some placement tests, it will return null for the next test's lesson ID if the last completed test had a score smaller than 90.\n- Alternatively, it will return the next available placement test's lesson ID if the score was greater than or equal to 90.\n\nAlso returns the 'onboarded' boolean that indicates if the student completed the onboarding process for the subject:\n- A 'onboarded = true' means they either completed and passed all placement tests or they have gotten a score smaller than 90 in the last completed placement test.\n- A 'onboarded = false' means they haven't completed placement tests yet or have achieved a score of 90 or greater in the last completed placement test and there are more tests to take.\n\nA 'Lesson' in this context is a ComponentResource object which has a Resource object with metadata.lessonType = \"placement\" associated with it.\n",
