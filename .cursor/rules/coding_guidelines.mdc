## Timeback Package Coding Guidelines

- Always use Pydantic V2 for all models.

Clear, enforceable rules for adding new endpoints, utilities, tests, and docs.

### 1) Endpoint placement by API path

- **Rule**: Place each endpoint under the correct service based on its API path.
  - OneRoster Rostering: `/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/...` → `timeback/services/oneroster/rostering/endpoints/`
  - OneRoster Gradebook: `/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/...` → `timeback/services/oneroster/gradebook/endpoints/`
  - OneRoster Resources: `/ims/oneroster/resources/v1p2/...` → `timeback/services/oneroster/resources/endpoints/`
  - PowerPath: `/powerpath/...` → `timeback/services/powerpath/endpoints/` (when added)
  - CASE: `/ims/case/v1p1/...` → `timeback/services/case/endpoints/` (when added)
  - QTI, Caliper: use their dedicated service trees when scaffolded

Example path mapping:

```text
GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/users/{sourcedId}
→ timeback/services/oneroster/rostering/endpoints/get_user.py
```

### 2) Service classes contain no business logic

- Rule: Service classes expose methods only; they must call a single endpoint function per method.
- Rule: All logic lives in the endpoint function file or imported utilities.

Example (`RosteringService`):

```python
# timeback/services/oneroster/rostering/rostering_service.py
from timeback.http import HttpClient
from timeback.models.timeback_user import TimebackUser
from timeback.services.oneroster.rostering.endpoints.get_user import get_user as get_user_endpoint

class RosteringService:
    """Rostering service methods for OneRoster."""

    def __init__(self, http: HttpClient):
        self._http = http

    def get_user(self, sourced_id: str) -> TimebackUser:
        return get_user_endpoint(self._http, sourced_id)
```

### 3) One file per endpoint; descriptive name

- **Rule**: Each endpoint has exactly one file named after the action, placed under `.../endpoints/`.
- **Rule**: The file exports one public function that performs the call and returns a typed model.

Example endpoint function:

```python
# timeback/services/oneroster/rostering/endpoints/get_user.py
from typing import Any, Dict
from timeback.http import HttpClient
from timeback.models.timeback_user import TimebackUser
from timeback.services.oneroster.rostering.utils.parse_user_response import parse_user_response

def get_user(http: HttpClient, sourced_id: str) -> TimebackUser:
    data: Dict[str, Any] = http.get(f"/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/users/{sourced_id}")
    return parse_user_response(data)
```

### 4) Extract non-trivial logic into utilities

- **Rule**: Any parsing/transform/validation beyond trivial parameter plumbing goes into `.../utils/`.
- **Rule**: Utilities are imported by endpoint files (never the service).
- **Rule**: Utility functions are strict 1 function per file.

Example utility:

```python
# timeback/services/oneroster/rostering/utils/parse_user_response.py
from typing import Any, Dict
from timeback.models.timeback_user import TimebackUser
from timeback.errors import ParseError

def parse_user_response(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> TimebackUser:
    try:
        payload = data.get("user", data)
        return TimebackUser.model_validate(payload)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ParseError(f"Failed to parse User response: {e}") from e
```

### 5) Typed responses using Pydantic models and Enums

- **Rule**: Every service method, endpoint, and utility returns a concrete Pydantic model or typed value.
- **Rule**: Use enums from `timeback/enums/` where applicable.
- **Rule**: Validate and normalize API data into models before returning.

Example signature requirement:

```python
def get_user(http: HttpClient, sourced_id: str) -> TimebackUser: ...
```

### 6) Tests: structure, coverage, and cleanup

- **Rule**: Unit tests for every endpoint and utility, mirroring the service directory structure.

Structure:

```text
tests/
  unit/
    oneroster/rostering/endpoints/test_get_user.py
    oneroster/rostering/utils/test_parse_user_response.py (if needed)
```

Example unit test (mocking HTTP):

```python
def test_get_user_success():
    class MockHttp:  # minimal stub
        def get(self, path, params=None):
            return {"user": {"sourcedId": "u1", "givenName": "A", "familyName": "B", "enabledUser": True, "roles": [], "agents": [], "userProfiles": []}}

    user = get_user(MockHttp(), "u1")
    assert user.sourcedId == "u1"
```

Integration test cleanup pattern:

```python
# Pseudocode; ensure any created resource is deleted in teardown/finally
created = create_resource(...)
try:
    fetched = get_resource(created.id)
    assert fetched.id == created.id
finally:
    delete_resource(created.id)
```

### 7) Documentation per endpoint

- **Rule**: Each endpoint gets a short doc page under `timeback/docs/` mirroring service structure.
- **Rule**: Include: purpose, request path/params, response model, and example usage.

Example doc location:

```text
timeback/docs/oneroster/rostering/get_user.md
```

### 8) Naming, structure, and imports

- **Rule**: Descriptive filenames and function names (e.g., `get_user.py`, `list_classes.py`).
- **Rule**: Keep imports local and minimal in endpoint files; avoid cross-service imports.
- **Rule**: No circular imports; utilities must not import service classes.

### 9) HTTP usage

- **Rule**: Use the injected `HttpClient` only in endpoint functions.
- **Rule**: Build full path strings that match the API spec; query params are explicit dicts.
- **Rule**: Let `HttpClient` raise typed errors; do not catch unless adding actionable context.

### 10) Comments and docstrings

- **Rule**: Service classes: brief class docstring only.
- **Rule**: Endpoint files: short header comment explaining purpose and path.
- **Rule**: Utilities: docstring with rationale and edge cases if non-obvious.

### Quick checklist (per endpoint)

- Correct service folder by path
- One endpoint file, one public function
- No logic in service class; service calls endpoint function
- Complex logic extracted to utilities
- Typed return model (Pydantic + Enums)
- Unit tests for endpoint and utilities
- Endpoint doc added under `timeback/docs/...`
