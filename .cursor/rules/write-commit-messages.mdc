# Commit Message Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Be concise and direct** - State what was done without unnecessary words
2. **No emojis** - Keep messages professional and universal
3. **Explain the change, not the diff** - Describe the outcome or purpose, not individual file changes
4. **Use imperative mood** - Write as if giving a command (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
5. **Limit subject line to 72 characters** - Ensures readability in all git tools
6. **Use lists sparingly** - For commits with multiple distinct changes, a bulleted list in the body is acceptable

## Format
```
[type]: [subject in imperative mood]

Optional body with additional context or list of changes when needed
```

### Types

- **feat** - New feature for the user
- **fix** - Bug fix
- **refactor** - Code restructuring without changing behavior
- **perf** - Performance improvement
- **test** - Adding or updating tests
- **docs** - Documentation changes
- **style** - Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no functional changes)
- **chore** - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config, etc.)

## Examples

**Good:**
- `feat: Add password reset functionality`
- `fix: Prevent crash when user profile is incomplete`
- `refactor: Simplify authentication logic`
- `perf: Optimize database queries for user search`
- `test: Add integration tests for payment flow`
- `docs: Update API authentication guide`
- `style: Format user service files`
- `chore: Bump axios to version 1.6.0`

**With body/list (when needed):**
```
refactor: Restructure user authentication module

- Move validation logic to separate utility
- Extract token refresh into dedicated service
- Update error handling for better clarity
```

**Avoid:**
- ❌ `feat: onboarding` (too vague)
- ❌ `fix: fixed the bug` (redundant and not descriptive)
- ❌ `Updated files` (missing type, unclear what changed)
- ❌ `feat: Added new feature to onboarding` (past tense, "new feature" is redundant)
